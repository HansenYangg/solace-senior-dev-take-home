# Task A src/

This directory is intentionally left empty.

The actual Lambda code for Task A is located in:

```
task-A/infra/solace sam/hello_world/
```

All deployment, handler, and supporting code can be found there too (might be a bit unconventional, but had a little hiccup and this was the easiest solution).
